    "# Q1: What are the Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF)? Explain with an example.\n",
    "Probability Mass Function (PMF):\n",
    "The PMF is used for discrete random variables and gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability Density Function (PDF):\n",
    "The PDF is used for continuous random variables and represents the likelihood of a random variable taking a value within a given range. The probability that a variable falls within an interval is the integral of the PDF over that interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2: What is Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)? Explain with an example. Why is the CDF used?\n",
    "Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF):\n",
    "The CDF is used to describe the cumulative probability that a random variable X takes a value less than or equal to a given value x. It is defined for both discrete and continuous random variables and is the integral (sum for discrete) of the PDF/PMF.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is CDF used?: The CDF is useful because it allows for the calculation of the probability that a variable falls within a specific range (i.e., between two values). It helps to compare different distributions and provides a complete description of the distribution of a random variable.\n",

    "# Q3: What are some examples of situations where the normal distribution might be used as a model? Explain how the parameters of the normal distribution relate to the shape of the distribution.\n",
    "Examples of Normal Distribution Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "Heights of people: Heights tend to follow a normal distribution, with most people being close to the average height.\n",
    "Test scores: In large groups, test scores often form a bell curve with most students clustering around the mean.\n",
    "Measurement errors: Small random errors in measurements tend to be normally distributed due to the central limit theorem.\n",
    "Relation of Parameters to Shape:\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean (\n",
    "ùúá\n",
    "Œº) determines the center of the distribution (the peak of the bell curve).\n",
    "The standard deviation (\n",
    "ùúé\n",
    "œÉ) controls the spread of the distribution. A larger standard deviation means the curve is wider and shorter, while a smaller standard deviation means the curve is narrower and taller.\n",

    "# Q4: Explain the importance of Normal Distribution. Give a few real-life examples of Normal Distribution.\n",
    "Importance of Normal Distribution:\n",
    "The normal distribution is important because it is widely used in statistics due to its properties and the fact that many natural and social phenomena tend to follow it.\n",
    "It is also fundamental in inferential statistics for hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis.\n",
    "Real-life Examples:\n",
    "IQ Scores: IQ scores in the population are often modeled as a normal distribution with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.\n",
    "Blood Pressure: In healthy adults, systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings often follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "Stock Returns: In finance, daily stock returns are often modeled as normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q5: What is Bernoulli Distribution? Give an Example. What is the difference between Bernoulli Distribution and Binomial Distribution?\n",
    "Bernoulli Distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bernoulli distribution models the probability of a single trial with two possible outcomes: success (1) and failure (0). It is a discrete probability distribution for a random variable that takes the value 1 with probability p (success) and 0 with probability 1‚àíp (failure).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Tossing a fair coin: success (1) for heads, failure (0) for tails. The Bernoulli distribution would be p=0.5 for heads and 1‚àíp=0.5 for tails.\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference Between Bernoulli and Binomial Distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernoulli Distribution: Models a single trial with two possible outcomes.\n",
    "Binomial Distribution: Models multiple independent Bernoulli trials, each with the same probability of success. It gives the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q6: Consider a dataset with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. If we assume that the dataset is normally distributed, what is the probability that a randomly selected observation will be greater than 60? Use the appropriate formula and show your calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Standardize the value using the z-score formula\n",
    "where: x=60 (the observation we are interested in),Œº=50 (mean),œÉ=10 (standard deviation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Find the probability corresponding to the z-score: For a z-score of 1, we look up the cumulative probability from the standard normal distribution table. The CDF value at z=1 is approximately 0.8413.\n",

    "# Q7: Explain Uniform Distribution with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniform Distribution:\n",
    "The uniform distribution is a type of probability distribution in which all outcomes are equally likely within a certain range. It can be either discrete or continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q8: What is the Z-Score? State the importance of the Z-Score.\n",
    "Z-Score:\n",
    "The Z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations a data point is away from the mean of the dataset. It is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Z-score helps in standardizing values from different distributions to compare them directly.\n",
    "It is used to identify outliers (typically values with a Z-score greater than 3 or less than -3) and in hypothesis testing.\n",

    "# Q9: What is the Central Limit Theorem? State the significance of the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Central Limit Theorem (CLT):\n",
    "The CLT states that the distribution of the sum (or average) of a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables approaches a normal distribution, regardless of the original distribution of the variables, as the sample size increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Significance:\n",
    "\n",
    "The CLT allows us to apply normal distribution techniques to sample means, even if the population distribution is not normal.\n",
    "It forms the basis for many statistical tests and confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q10: State the assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence: The random variables should be independent of each other.\n",
    "Identically Distributed: The random variables should have the same probability distribution.\n",
    "Sample Size: The sample size should be sufficiently large (typically n‚â•30).\n",
    "Finite Variance: The population from which the sample is drawn should have a finite variance."
